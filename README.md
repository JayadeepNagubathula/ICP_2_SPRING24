# ICP_2_SPRING24_ASSIGN_2

In this repo I have created some more python programs using main function calling and passing varaiables to other functions and converting the height from inches to centimetres. Mainly i have used the input file from the users to count the words in the file and display it on another file in count_words source code. Please do check the video and document provided for you. 

##THANK YOU ALL
