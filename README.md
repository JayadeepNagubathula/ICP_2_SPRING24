# ICP_2_SPRING24_ASSIGN_2

In this repo I have created some more python programs using main function calling and passing varaiables to other functions and converting the height from inches to centimetres. 

Mainly do check my count_words code in which i have taken the text file from user and counted the words from that file and display it on another file in count_words source code. Please do check the video and document provided for you.

##THANK YOU ALL
